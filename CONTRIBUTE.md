# Got an idea for a component?

You can start coding right away but in order for us to organize the build, please follow these steps

1. Open an issue in our gitHub repo https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/web3-unity-sdk/issues
2. Give the issue a title prefixed with feature, bugFix, docs or chore
3. Describe what you will build, or fix as best you can so we know what to expect
4. Add any examples like images, design ideas or CodePen mockups
5. Be open to refinement of your idea
6. Stay in communication, once we accept the proposal we want that update. If you disappear we might finish it for you or pass it to another dev
7. To complete your task and be merged, you should read about Pull Requests below
8. In need of inspiration? Keep an eye on the issue board as our team will open issues for you and even add new designs for components we need, hot from our Moralis design UX team.

# NewComp

Just a friendly heads up incase you missed that above...
We have made a component called `NewComp` you can copy and paste this component to get started but don't change it or we will reject your pull request, sorry. Suggestions are welcome but we are pretty happy with it.
This component has an example of just about everything with a friendly non programmer comment to help you learn, how we do things, why we do them and what we expect when it comes to a pull request.

Lets take a tour and look at some of our standards


# Pull Request

For your pull request please follow this guide

## Branch Name

`pull request type + task`

-   so if i add a new tokenapi addon my branch is `feat-addedTokenApi`

**Pull request types:**

-   feat = new feature
-   fix = bug fix
-   docs = added or changed documentation
-   chore = some mindless work, like reformatting

So if i fix the validation to the `Form` my branch is `fix-form-validation`... you get it, right? 😅

## Conventional Commits

We follow a strict convectional commits pattern, and please if you change more than one component, then have 1 commit per components. No monster PRs please, its hard to review them if you change 500 files in one go, lol

## PR Feedback

We are all students in this journey of life, so please accept any critique given. We are just trying to help you out or align your code with our base perhaps. This is a difficult but important part of collaboration and team work.
lets **review each others code and PRs**

**Q:** Why peer review?

**A:** So we can all learn from each other, the rising tide brings up all ships.

&nbsp;

# Approval

Don't forget we can approve and merge your code but you need to add your component to the projects base `index.ts` so the next dev can use it.
